# sort-weblinks

## Introduction

I have a lot of links which I have been saving and just putting into a file called my-weblinks.txt
For some of the links, I had created a heading to define what the links were about and also added a short description for a majority of the links in the format:

<header>
<description>: <URL/web-link>

After some time it became difficult (when the file reached 1000+ lines/links), to search and figure out or remember what the links without a header or a description were for or if they were alive or not.
Hence, this attempt to sort and give meaning to eah of the web-links/URL's

## Issues and Error solutions

### 1. IndexError: index 1096 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1092

The error we're encountering is happening because there's a mismatch between the number of entries being processed.

Modify the code to handle blank lines and pre-grouped links more effectively

#### Key Fixes:

- Group Header Detection: Now detects lines ending with a colon that don't contain URLs as group headers
- Handling Existing Groups: Preserves any existing groupings you already have
- Empty Description Handling: Better handling of entries without descriptions
- TF-IDF Parameters: Adjusted parameters to work with smaller groups of data
- Proper error handling: Makes sure we only process entries that have descriptions

#### Additional improvements:

The code now distinguishes between:

- Pre-existing groups you already created
- Auto-detected domain-based groups
- Text similarity-based clusters

It handles blank lines and section headers like Test Management 2.0: as group titles


### 2. ValueError: max_df corresponds to < documents than min_df

This happens in the TF-IDF vectorization step where you're setting:

min_df=1 (terms must appear in at least 1 document)
max_df=0.9 (terms can appear in at most 90% of documents)

The error occurs when these constraints conflict - specifically when you have very few documents to cluster. If you have only a small number of remaining entries to cluster, setting max_df=0.9 might result in requiring a term to appear in fewer documents than the min_df=1 requirement.

#### Solution

An edge case. We need to make the vectorizer more robust for small document sets.

#### Key Changes Made

- Dynamic Vectorizer Configuration:
I've added code to dynamically adjust the TF-IDF vectorizer parameters based on the corpus size
For small document sets (5 or fewer), the code now uses min_df=1 and max_df=1.0 to prevent the conflict

- Error Handling:
Added a try-except block around the vectorization and clustering steps
If clustering fails, it will fall back to grouping remaining entries as "Miscellaneous" instead of crashing

- DBSCAN Parameter Adjustment:
Added dynamic adjustment of the min_samples parameter based on document count
For very small datasets (3 or fewer), it now uses min_samples=1

#### Explanation of the Error
This error occurs because:

min_df=1 means terms must appear in at least 1 document
max_df=0.9 means terms must appear in at most 90% of documents

With a very small number of documents, these constraints can become mathematically impossible to satisfy. For example, with just 2 documents:

90% of 2 = 1.8, rounded down to 1

This means terms can appear in at most 1 document (max_df)
But min_df also requires terms to appear in at least 1 document
This creates a situation where terms must appear in exactly 1 document, which may not be possible given the actual content

The solution adaptively adjusts these parameters based on our dataset size, making our code much more robust.
